This is DDR4 SODIM ram so make sure that your board is compatible2. Some RAM is soldered in and cannot be replaced.3. Lookup your laptop and find where the RAM is before you start (Youtube teardown videos are usually good)4. Check how many RAM sockets you have as some laptops only have 1. you most likely have 2Before you start:1. Remove any wool or nylon clothing (static is a huge killer of laptops)2. Remove any headphones or things dangling down3. make sure your work area is as clear as possible and you have a small pot for any screwsTo install:1. After locating the RAM slots you will see 2 silver (or black) clips, one either side of the chip. Gently pull these out to the side until the old RAM chip pops up.2. Remove the old chip and put it somewhere safe (avoid anything that can conduct static)3. Remove the new stick out of its packaging, avoid touching the golden teeth (not the end of the world if you do, just good practice).4. Insert the RAM into the socket at a 45 degree angle making sure to line up the gap in the bottom to the notch in the socket.5. gently press down until you hear the lips click into place.While you're in there you may as well give the fans a clean. remove as much dust as you can, Compressed air and/or a microfiber brush is good for this."},{"title":"CT2K8G4SFRA32A bundle is two CT8G4SFRA32A sticks.
